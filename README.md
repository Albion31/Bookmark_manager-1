## SQL

It means Structured Query Language

## CRUD

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.  
They are the four basic functions of persistent storage.  

The letters map to commands from different things

Operation | SQL | HTTP
----------|-----|------
Create | INSERT | POST / PUT
Read(Retrieve) | SELECT | GET
Update(modify) | UPDATE | POST/PUT/PATCH
Delete(destroy) | DELETE | Delete

#### Create
Creates new rows in the table
Example: INSERT INTO "students" (NAME) VALUES ('a name');

- Where the column names are declared, we omit ID, because it's a value generated by SQL
- When passing strings to populate the rows, we use single quotes
- SQL reserves double quotes for table names

#### Read

Example: SELECT * FROM students;

- Asks the database to select everything from the table students


#### Update

Example: UPDATE "students" SET NAME = 'a name' WHERE ID = 1;

#### Delete

Example: DELETE FROM "students" WHERE ID = 1;
